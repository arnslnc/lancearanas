    <h1>ECMASCRIPT</h1>

    <h2>Learning on EcmaScript</h2>
    <p>In the year 1994, in Mountain View California, a company was founded by
    the name Mosaic Communications. They recruited the initial authors who wrote NCSA Mosaic
    to rewrite the exact same product which they called Mosaic Netscape. Within the first 
    four months of its release, it became the leading browser in the market, at that time,
    it captured 75% of the market share. Because of legal issues, they changed the 
    name of the browser to Netscape Navigator, and they changed their company name to 
    Netscape Communications.<br><br>In 1995, Brendan Eich accepted the challenge to create 
    another programming language, and after ten days, he came up with a prototype called 
    Mocha. In 1996, Netscape submitted JavaScript to ECMA International in order to define
    standards to be implemented, which could then be shared to other browser vendors so that
    they can implement similar functions to their browsers.<br><br> ECMA released
    <b>ECMAScript</b>, which was published in the ECMA-262 standard, which was released in 
    June 1997 with JavaScript being the most well-known implementation of that standard.
    Subsequent versions of the standard were then released on after the other: ECMASCRIPT 2 
    in June 1998, ECMASCRIPT 3 in December 1999. Even though the work for ECMASCRIPT 4 was
    started in 2000, it never actually got released. This was because Microsoft, a major
    player in the browser market, had made its intentions clear to not implement proper 
    JavaScript in the Internet Explorer, nor did they have any competing proposal for the
    same.</p>
