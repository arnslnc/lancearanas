    <h1>Using Kahoot! In the Classroom</h1>
    <img src = "kahoot.jpg" width="700px" height="600px">
    <p>Kahoot! is a game-based learning and trivia platform. What makes Kahoot! so great is that it has uses beyond the classroom; 
        it can be used in offices and social settings, making it a hit for all ages. This means that some parents may be familiar with Kahoot! 
        as well. Kahoot! can be used from any device (through the website or the app), making learning fun and inclusive in all contexts for all ages. 
        Teachers can create multiple choice games related to class content that students can play as a class by entering the game code on their app or device. 
        Kahoot! offers a multitude of other forms of games related to class content that can make learning fun.<br><br>Instead of using a worksheet at the end 
        of a lesson for assessment, consider using Kahoot! It’s a fun and effective way to measure which concepts your students  understand fully — and which 
        might need reinforcement. If you’re looking to end class on an exciting note, Kahoot! is a great way to have fun while also utilizing class concepts. 
        Looking for a way to energize your students? Use Kahoot! as a bellringer or class starter to get students engaged at the beginning of class. You can also 
        use Kahoot! before introducing a new concept as a form of pre-assessment to see how much students know about the new content. It can be used throughout a 
        lesson to measure student engagement and understanding. This can be done by introducing content, then using Kahoot! to see what students understand and have 
        them explain why the answer is correct.</p>
