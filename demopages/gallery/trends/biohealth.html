    <h1>The use of drones in delivering medical supplies</h1>
    <img src = "drone.jpg" width="700px" height="600px">
    <p>In March, WakeMed Health & Hospitals in North Carolina, UPS, and the drone company Matternet, teamed up to test whether drones could help providers speed up the process of transporting lab samples to and from medical facilities. For the pilot program, FAA authorized WakeMed Health & Hospitals to use commercial drones to transport lab samples from WakeMed's medical park to the hospital's main building for lab testing.

        The pilot drone, Matternet's M2 "quadcopter" drone, is equipped with a secure box that contains the vials of blood or other lab specimens. The drone can carry medical samples of up to five pounds as far as 12.5 miles.
        
        In July, UPS created the subsidiary, called Flight Forward, and sought FAA approval to operate drones to ship medical specimens.</p>
